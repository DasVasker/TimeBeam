                  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> |                | <kbd>D</kbd>   | Deselect all

### Selection
By default, anything that *intersects* with the selection rectangle is selected.  
If you hold <kbd>Alt</kbd>, anything that is *contained* within the selection rectangle is selected.  
Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> allows you pick single tracks in and out of the selection.  
Clicking the labels at the start of a track will select all track elements on that track.
